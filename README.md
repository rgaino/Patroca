# Patroca
This is the source code for my abandoned projet Patroca. It was a social bartering app based on Facebook. In 2016 Facebook made a few changes that rendered the app unusable, so we abandoned it. Lesson learned.

The app used Parse.com as a backend. Facebook also shut down Parse but I don't think this is personal. And you shouldn't either.
